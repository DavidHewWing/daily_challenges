## Advice from L4 Google Offer:
* Prep every day but make sure to also take breaks
* Solve the same question more than once (on different days). It's encouraging to feel like you learned how to solve it and also ensure you're retaining what you learn
* Ignore the ranking information. I found it very useless to know that all my answer were at the bottom 50% of submissions.
* Get Leetcode premium if you can afford it. The top 2 features were
* * Ranking questions by how frequently they were asked at a given company in the last month
* * Access to all solutions
* Don't worry or stress too much about getting your code to compile. None of the companies I interviewed with except Airbnb expected the code to compile perfectly down to the variable names / commas. Focus more on understanding the question and solution
* If you find a really hard question that you don't understand just look at the solution and then try to understand that. If you don't understand that then look in the forum for detailed explanations of the example solution or for alternative solutions that may make more sense to you. You can also try google for YouTube explanations of the question. After all of this if you don't get it, don't worry. Just move on.
* When onsite it is ok to feel like you are not nailing the questions. Just communicate every single thought going through your head.
Delete the Blind app. Redownload it if you get an offer. The app made me feel awful every step of the way and contributed nothing but panic and anxiety.
