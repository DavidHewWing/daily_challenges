# Daily Things

## Daily Check-list:
1. Whiteboard an old question.
2. Whiteboard a new question.
3. Optional - Coursera - 2-4 Lectures and Work.
4. Optional - Do some Technical Question Review

## LeetCode Studying Approach

1. Do Breadth-First Scan of ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù questions from each Topic on Leetcode
    1. Try to get it right on the first try
    2. Should be finishing these in < 10 minutes
    3. Take note of which sections you struggled at (the following was for me)
        1. Trees
        2. Dynamic Programming
2. Do more ‚ÄúEasy‚Äù questions from the topics you struggled at
3. Shuffle ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù problems
    1. Only do the problems you are not 100% sure how to do
    2. Start a 25 minute pomodoro timer and attempt to solve it
    3. If the problem isn‚Äôt solved in 25 minutes, take a look at the discussion section but do NOT look at code just yet
        1. Reset the timer and do another pomodoro
        2. Once the problem is done, look at the discussion section and understand how other people solved it
        3. Write this problem down in your notes as a problem you need to revisit
4. Do the popular ‚ÄúHard‚Äù problems from each Topic
    1. Try to finish these within 45 minutes
5. Do a mock interview AT LEAST once a week
6. Towards the last month of interview prep, do the 1-month term plan in EPI on PAPER

## Advice from L4 Google Offer:
* Okta - Went well
* Prep every day but make sure to also take breaks
* Solve the same question more than once (on different days). It's encouraging to feel like you learned how to solve it and also ensure you're retaining what you learn
* Ignore the ranking information. I found it very useless to know that all my answer were at the bottom 50% of submissions.
* Get Leetcode premium if you can afford it. The top 2 features were
* * Ranking questions by how frequently they were asked at a given company in the last month
* * Access to all solutions
* Don't worry or stress too much about getting your code to compile. None of the companies I interviewed with except Airbnb expected the code to compile perfectly down to the variable names / commas. Focus more on understanding the question and solution
* If you find a really hard question that you don't understand just look at the solution and then try to understand that. If you don't understand that then look in the forum for detailed explanations of the example solution or for alternative solutions that may make more sense to you. You can also try google for YouTube explanations of the question. After all of this if you don't get it, don't worry. Just move on.
* When onsite it is ok to feel like you are not nailing the questions. Just communicate every single thought going through your head.
Delete the Blind app. Redownload it if you get an offer. The app made me feel awful every step of the way and contributed nothing but panic and anxiety.
