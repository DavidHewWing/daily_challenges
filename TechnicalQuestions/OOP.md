# Object Oriented Programming

### Class vs. Object
A class is a collection of variables and methods, and is a blueprint for an object. When you make a class, you can instantiate objects from that class.

### Basics
**Abstraction:**

Hides internal implementation details

**Encapsulation:**

Attribute of an object, and it contains all data which is hidden. That hidden data can be restricted to the members of that class

Public (anyone), Protected (package), Private (class)

**Inheritance:**

One class shares the structure and behavior defined in another class.

**Polymorphism:**

Assigning behavior or value in a subclass that was already declared in the main class. Polymorphism = something takes more than one form.\

**Constructor**:

The method that is called when you initialize the object.
