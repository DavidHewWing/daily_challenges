### Pattern 1: Sliding Window
* Use when you need to keep a contiguous subarray or substring
* Always keep a reference to the start of the window
* Best way to solve is to visualize the window
* You also have to identify if the window size is always going to be the same (fixed) or you have to shrink/expand it

### Pattern 2: Two Pointers
* Usually deals with sorted arrays
* 2Sum and other mathimatical questions
* Approach by putting hi pointer and lo pointer
